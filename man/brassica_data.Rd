    \title{Genotypic and phenotypic dataset for brassica napus}
    \format{A data frame with 50 rows as genotypes with 103 columns (i.e. contains information of genotyped markers and phenotypic traits).}
    \details{
    In brassica_data, it has total 50 rows which represents particular genotypes and a total of 103 of columns, in which first 100 columns contain information of genotyped markers and remaining three columns represent value of phenotypic traits associated with genotype under study.

    \description{
     Dataset used in this study is related to Brassica napus (Kole et al, 2002). In our sample dataset it has 3 response for 50 lines (individuals) which are genotyped for 100 markers. Lines are derived from two cultivars namely Stellar and Major. Marker genotypes are represented in 0/1, where 0 represents a Stellar allele and 1 represents Major allele. Response are related to days of flowering at different weeks of vernlization (flower0, flower4, flower8).
